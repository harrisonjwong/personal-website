This is my new personal website built in [React](https://reactjs.org).

I used this [tutorial](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) to set up hosting on Github Pages.

I also used this [tutorial](https://blog.pshrmn.com/simple-react-router-v4-tutorial/) to setup multipage.

TODO:

- [x] Setup github page
- [x] Create new homepage
- [x] Sidebar
- [x] About page
  - [x] Links (email, linkedin, github, resume.pdf)
  - [x] Education (Northeastern, NSHS)
  - [x] Experience (PA, TAing)
- [x] Skills page
  - [x] Languages
  - [x] Frameworks
  - [x] Software
- [x] Projects page (new page for each)
  - [ ] Greenline
  - [ ] animator
  - [ ] maze game
  - [ ] tictactoe
  - [ ] this website
  - [ ] more...
- [x] Interests page
  - [ ] podcasts
  - [ ] youtubers (hmm)
  - [ ] tv
  - [ ] cooking (lol)

Bugs:

- [ ] Get the app bar to display the correct page name upon loading
- [ ] (maybe) make the projects page look slightly better
- [ ] Use images instead of text on skills page
