This is my personal portfolio website built in [React](https://reactjs.org) and hosted by GitHub Pages.

It supports multiple pages with ReactRouter's HashRouter (which allows for links to use a # so it can still be contained on a single page, a requirement for github pages).

TODO:

- [x] Setup github page

I used this [tutorial](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) to set up hosting on GitHub Pages.
I also used this [tutorial](https://blog.pshrmn.com/simple-react-router-v4-tutorial/) to setup multipage.
